# js-blockchain
A deeper dive into blockchain by building one in JavaScript, with similar functionality found in production-level blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

This project contains:

- A proof of work algorithm to secure the network.
- Hashing algorithms to secure the data within the blockchain.
- The ability to mine (create) new, immutable, blocks that contain data.
- The ability to create transactions and store them in blocks.
- An API that will be used to interact with the blockchain from the internet.
- It will be hosted on a decentralized blockchain network.
- Consensus algorithms to verify that the network nodes have valid data and are synchronized.
- A broadcasting system to keep the data in the blockchain network synchronized.

## What is a Blockchain
### "An immutable, distributed ledger"
**Ledger** - "a collection of financial accoounts or transactions"
**Distributed** - Not controlled by one single entity. Run by many nodes (people/groups).
